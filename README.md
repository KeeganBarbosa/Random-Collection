# Random-Collection
This is a collection of assorted codes I find relevant or interesting. Topics include:


- Data analysis on Kaggle datasets (currently: Bitcoin/NFT rugpulls, and Twitter Bots)

- Engle-Granger cointegration computed explicitly (gradient descent to be implimented instead in future)

- Arbitrage check algorithm. 

- Graph algorithms, and graph object class.
